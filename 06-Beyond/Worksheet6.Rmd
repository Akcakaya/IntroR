User Defined Functions
----------

1. Describe the components and arguments of the following function.

```{r}
largest<-function(x,y,z){
  a<-c(x,y,z)
  l<-which.max(a)
  paste(a[l],"is the largest number")
}
```

2. Create and test a function that takes in two vectors and determines which is the longer vector. 
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
